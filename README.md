## The problem

Lets say you like the comfort of making semantic-release publishing your work to
npm and/or Github (you should!) but your build step requires the version to be
present in package.json to make it work. This works with earlier versions of
semantic-release (<8), but not with the newer ones (>8).

## The solution

`semantic-release-build` is a fairly simple and rather naÃ¯ve approach to the
problem. It's a plugin for the
[`publish`-hook](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#publish)
for `semantic-release`. It will simply spawn `npm run build` (or `yarn`) after
`semantic-release` has determined the new version. It will first rewrite your
`package.json` with the new version number. Then run `npm/yarn run build`. And
then restore `package.json` to it's original state. This way you can get the
version number of your project inside e.g. a banner comment in toy build
artifacts.

## Setup

The plugin is supposed to run inside the `publish`-hook for `semantic-release`.
You don't have to set `npm` or `yarn` explicitly. By default it will run
`npm run build`. But if `yarn` is available in your path (`which yarn`) and if a
`yarn.lock`-file is present in your projects root it will run `yarn run build`.

### Basic setup

Inside `package.json`:

```json
"release": {
  // ...your other plugins settings
  "publish": [
    "semantic-release-build",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github"
  ]
}
```

**Disclaimer:** Make sure that `semantic-release-build` runs before other
plugins, otherwise it will have no effect.

### Extended setup

`semantic-release-build` can be customized in one way â€“ you can specify flags to
attatch to your `npm run build` call.

Note that you don't have to attatch the extra `--` which is usually required by
`npm`. It will be attatched for you. This is to make it work seamlessly between
`npm` and `yarn`.

Inside `package.json`:

```json
"release": {
  // ...your other plugins settings
  "publish": [
    {
      "path": "semantic-release-build",
      "flags": "--out-dir build"
    }
  ]
}
```
